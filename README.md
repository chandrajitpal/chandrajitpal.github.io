Biography


Dr Pal is a Senior Research Officer at the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex. In addition, he is a member of the school's Embedded and Intelligent Systems (EIS) Research Group. Before that, he was a National Post-doctoral Fellow (SERB awarded, DST, Govt of India) at IIT Hyderabad, India.  He received a PhD in Information Technology from the University of Calcutta. He was awarded the prestigious Presidential DST INSPIRE Fellowship by the Govt of India in 2018 to carry out his doctoral studies. He also worked as a Newton Bhabha Fellow in the School of Electronics and Computer Science department at the University of Southampton, UK in 2016. 
His research interests mainly include computer vision and signal processing algorithms, custom computing using FPGAs, embedded systems and hardware/software co-design. Besides his interest in intelligent signal processing algorithms, his research also involves developing energy-efficient heterogeneous architectures to execute deep learning techniques on embedded edge devices with limited resources and latency budgets. His research has resulted in over 40 refereed conference and journal papers, patents and book chapters. Before returning to academic research, Dr Pal worked as an AI Research Engineer and Senior Engineer in the semiconductor industry.

Presently contributing to an EPSRC project by DSBD named MORELLO-HAT in collaboration with the University of Glasgow and the University of Oxford.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION:
The CHERI project has created the infrastructure for hardware capabilities. The Morello project implements these concepts and tools for the Arm architecture. In terms of programming languages, the focus of CHERI and Morello has been primarily on C but considerable work has also been done on C++ and some more preliminary work on Rust. The Morello-HAT project (Morello High-Level API and Tooling) intends to create a common API that can be used by compiler developers as well as programmers of higher-level languages, to allow them to leverage Morello's HW capabilities to improve memory security and type safety, spatial as well as temporal, of their language and programs.
